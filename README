## Emacs Notes
| Command| Description |
| --- | --- |
| `C-<chr>` | means hold the CONTROL key while typing the character <chr>. Thus, C-f would be: hold the CONTROL key and type f. |
| `M-<chr>` | means hold the META or EDIT or ALT key down while typing <chr>. If there is no META, EDIT or ALT key, instead press and release the ESC key and then type <chr>.  We write <ESC> for the ESC key. |
| `C-x C-c` | end the Emacs session |
| `C-g` | quit a partially entered command |
| `C-v` | Move forward one screenful |
| `M-v` | Move backward one screenful |
| `C-l` | Clear screen and redisplay all the text, moving the text around the cursor to the center of the screen. (That's CONTROL-L, not CONTROL-1.) |
